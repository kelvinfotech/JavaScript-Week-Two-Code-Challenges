(II) Array Generator function Between Two Numbers which basically takes two parameters which are 'start' and 'end', then represents the starting and ending values of the range, respectively.
(III) Returning Array of Prime Numbers function From Original Array which basically takes a number as input and returns 'true' if it is a prime number and 'false/[]' if otherwise.
